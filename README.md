A little package for calculating the current-flow centrality of nodes in a network. This extends the concept
of betweeness and closeness based in shortest paths to those based on all paths, with the intuitive interpretation
of electrical current in an electrical network.

Consult:

Newman, M. E. J. (2005). A measure of betweenness centrality based on random walks. Social Networks, 27(1), 39-54. doi:10.1016/j.socnet.2004.11.009

... for a detailed mathematical treatment

The other purpose of this package is to teach myself a little more about Rcpp and how to write packages that use it.

In order to install, run:

```
> remotes::install_github("adamsardar/currentFlowCentrality")
```
