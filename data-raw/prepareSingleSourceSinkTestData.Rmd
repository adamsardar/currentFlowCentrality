Preparing an example of a single sink/source current flow. Taken from the [tutorial at](http://www.sci.unich.it/~francesc/teaching/network/flowcentrality.html).


```{r}

library(igraph)
library(magrittr)
library(data.table)

graphDT <- data.table(from = c("A","A","B","B","B","C","C","E","F","G"),
           to = c("B","C","C","E","F","D","G","F","G","H"),
           absoluteCurrent = c(0.47,0.53,0.07,0.13,0.27,0,0.6,0.13,0.4,1))

singleSTcurrentFlow <- graph.data.frame(graphDT) %>% as.undirected

V(singleSTcurrentFlow)$isSource <- FALSE
V(singleSTcurrentFlow)$isSink <- FALSE

V(singleSTcurrentFlow)[name == "A"]$isSource <- TRUE
V(singleSTcurrentFlow)[name == "H"]$isSink <- TRUE

refVals <- c(1,0.47,0.6,0,0.13,0.4,1,1)
names(refVals) <- c("A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H")
V(singleSTcurrentFlow)$absoluteFlow <- refVals[V(singleSTcurrentFlow)$name]


potentialVals <- c(0.77,0.3,0.23,0.23,0.17,0.03,-0.37,-1.37)
names(potentialVals) <- c("A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H")
V(singleSTcurrentFlow)$potential <- potentialVals[V(singleSTcurrentFlow)$name]


save(singleSTcurrentFlow,file="./data/singleSTcurrentFlow.RData")

```
