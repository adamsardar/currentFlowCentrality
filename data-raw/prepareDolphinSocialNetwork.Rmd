Newman and Lusseau have a paper describing the social network of a pod of dolphins in New Zealands. Why not? Anyway, it's an easy test for the current flow betweeness (Bozzo & Franceschet 2012 use it), so I'll make it available in this package.

```{r}

library(igraph)

dolphinPodLusseau <- read_graph("./data-raw/dolphins.gml",format="gml")

V(dolphinPodLusseau)$name <- V(dolphinPodLusseau)$label
dolphinPodLusseau %<>% delete_vertex_attr("label")

save(dolphinPodLusseau,file="data/dolphinPodLusseau.RData",compress = "xz")

```
